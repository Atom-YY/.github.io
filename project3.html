  <h1>This website</h1>
  <p>I am starting this website as my third project, used mainly to learn the basics of the HTML language. </p>
  <p>I am starting with some simple files that I have asked ChatGPT to make, and I plan to improve on this website by myself</p>
  <a> href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a website that I have found where I will/hopefully had learned HTML and Python as project 1</a>
  <p> as of this edition, I still don't understand how the link aspect should've used and how it will display so I'm just testing stuff out</p>
