  <h1>This website</h1>
  <p>I am starting this website as my third project, used mainly to learn the basics of the HTML language. </p>
  <p>I am starting with some simple files that I have asked ChatGPT to make, and I plan to improve on this website by myself</p>
  <p>My plan is to build upon what I currently have and to never delete code (in this page) unless there is a bug that it is causing,</p>
  <p> so that both I and whoever I show it to will be able to see my improvements.</p>


  <p>march 30th 2025 update</p>
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a website that I have found where I will/hopefully had learned HTML</a>
  <p>temp note: As of currently, I still don't understand how the link aspect should've used and how it will display so I'm just testing stuff out</p>
  <p>Also, in addition to my rule of not editing code in this page, I will edit the header, as it will be updated along with the other tabs</p>
