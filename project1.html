  <h1>My First Project</h1>
  <p>This is my first coding project, made following along a tutorial in an online streaming class, wanting to make a romantic little program to ask someone out.</p>
  <a href="https://github.com/Atom-YY/Atom-YY.github.io/blob/main/askout.py">Github link to my program</a>
  <p>I admit that the only thing different about this from Ctrl c+v is that I typed each letter while watching the stream,<br> but it is my first project that somewhat ran. Though I did not end up showing her the program</p>
